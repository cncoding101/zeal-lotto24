Let's pretend the service is already live and in use, and we have identified some improvements we would like to make:

1. Add `more customer data`: We would like to have those data fields stored inside the service: name, address, phone number
2. The result of the getCustomers becomes `too large` when we saved a lot of customers. Is there a way to circumvent that?
3. The `error-handling` is not optimal. The clients have difficulties retrieving the information on what went wrong and how to solve it. How can we improve that?
4. We noticed that we sometimes have `duplicate` customer numbers inside the application. How can we prevent that?
5. The `range` of possible customer numbers is not enough. We would like to have a way to extend that range.
6. We have other services which want to get updates about changes in the customer data. How can we `forward the information`?
7. We noticed some `performance issues` for getCustomer when we have a lot of saved customer documents. Is there a way to improve that?
8. The `test coverage` is not optimal. We would like to have all critical use cases tested.

You can either make the improvements yourself and present them to us afterward, or we can do the improvements together in a pair-programming session.

You can decide which way you prefer. You can also do a mix of the two options, preparing parts of the improvements, and we can do the rest together.
